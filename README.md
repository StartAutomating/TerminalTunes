## TerminalTunes

TerminalTunes is a music player for terminals.

Did you know that some terminals can play tunes?

Since 1.15, Windows Terminal has been able to play a limited range of notes using DECPS escape sequences.

TerminalTunes provides a little library of known tunes and a few tune generators to let you make your own music.
